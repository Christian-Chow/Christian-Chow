## Hi, I'm Christian! 👋 👨‍💻👮

Currently a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at HKUST, with hands-on experience as a software developer intern in multiple tech companies and as an auxiliary police officer in Hong Kong. I'm passionate about software development, especially full stack web and mobile app development, and I'm diving deeper into AI and cybersecurity. Let's connect and build something awesome!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Final year project at HKUST (developing self-repairing AI agents) and applying AI to full stack web and mobile app development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced topics in AI, cybersecurity, software development and devOps.
- 💬 Ask me about anything you want
- ⚡ Fun fact: Not only am I a Computer Engineering student at HKUST and got onto the Dean's List, I am also an auxiliary police officer in Hong Kong Police Forces, familiar with police procedures & do gym and dragon boat.
